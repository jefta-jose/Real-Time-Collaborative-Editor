### Real-Time Collaborative Editor - Requirements Document

**Project Overview:**
The goal is to develop a **Google Docs-style editor** that enables multiple users to collaboratively edit a document in real time. The application must provide seamless collaboration by implementing efficient real-time syncing, handling concurrency, and preventing data conflicts. It will utilize **WebSockets** or **WebRTC** for real-time communication,and **Operational Transforms (OT)**

**Key Features:**
1. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Allow multiple users to concurrently edit the same document.
   - Synchronize edits in real-time across all connected clients.
   - Display user cursors and selections in real-time to all collaborators.

2. **Operational Transforms (OT) or CRDT for Sync**:
   - Implement **Operational Transforms (OT)** to manage conflicting edits and maintain a consistent document state across all clients.
   - Handle race conditions (simultaneous edits) to ensure all changes are merged correctly.
   - Ensure eventual consistency between all client copies.

3. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - A text editor interface where users can edit the document.
   - Indicate active users with visual cues (e.g., colored cursors, name tags near cursor positions).
   - Support basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline, etc.).
   - Option to add collaborative features such as comments, chat, or revision history.

4. **User Management**:
   - Handle user sessions and document access permissions.
   - Show the list of active users editing the document.
   - Assign each user a unique color or visual identifier for collaborative actions (e.g., cursor movement, text highlighting).

5. **Document Storage & Persistence**:
   - Save the document in a database (MongoDB).
   - Support real-time auto-saving.
   - Provide a mechanism to restore previous document versions or view revision history.
   - Option to create, open, and edit multiple documents.

6. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - Use **WebSockets** for real-time two-way communication between clients and the server.
   - Alternatively, **WebRTC** can be explored for peer-to-peer communication without a centralized server.
   - Support efficient data synchronization without overwhelming the network with frequent updates.

7. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Use either OT to automatically resolve conflicts between multiple users' edits.
   - Ensure that edits are applied in the correct order and no changes are lost or overwritten incorrectly.
   - Provide visual feedback in the editor when conflicts occur.

8. **Scalability**:
   - Support a large number of simultaneous collaborators.
   - Efficiently handle large documents without lag.
   - Implement strategies for load balancing and scaling to manage increasing user traffic.

9. **State Management**:
   - Maintain the state of the document on both the client and server sides.
   - Use real-time synchronization strategies to ensure state consistency across all clients.
   - Handle edge cases such as users joining/leaving mid-session or network interruptions.

10. **Concurrency Handling**:
    - Prevent race conditions when multiple users are editing the document at the same time.
    - Maintain a consistent document structure despite multiple simultaneous edits.

**Technology Stack**:

**Frontend**:
   - **React.js**: For building a highly responsive and interactive user interface.
   - **Quill.js**: Rich-text editors to provide a base for the collaborative text editing.
   - **WebSockets**: For enabling real-time communication between clients and the server.
   - **Redux**: For managing state on the client side.

**Backend**:
   - **Node.js with Express**: Server-side runtime to handle WebSocket communication and routing.
   - **WebSocket (Socket.IO)**: For real-time client-server communication.
   - **Operational Transforms Library**: Implement the core conflict resolution logic.
   - **Database (MongoDB)**: To store documents, user sessions, and revision history.
   - **Redis**: (optional) For caching and managing real-time user session data.
